# CarND-Term2-P4-Model-Predictive-Control  
## Overview  
In this project you'll implement model predictive controller to drive the car around the track. You will need to extract the data and calculate the cross track error then compute the appropriate steering angle and acceleration and feed them back to the simulator to drive the vehicle around the track. Besides that, you can also plot your predicted trajectory in front of the vehicle to see how well your model is working. Remember, there is a 100 millisecond latency between actuations commands on top of the connection latency so you will need to handle that latency in your code.  
There is a simulator provided by Udacity ([Term 2 Simulator Release](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases/)) which will generate the state and actuator data. And you will be using those data to calculate the cross track error (CTE) then compute the appropriate control inputs then feed them back to the simulator to drive the vehicle.   
Here is the link to the [orginal repository](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-MPC-Project) provided by Udaciy. This repository contains all the code needed to complete the final project for the Model Predictive Control course in Udacity's Self-Driving Car Nanodegree.

## Project Description  
- [main.cpp](./src/main.cpp):Reads in data, calls a function to initialize and run the model predictive controller on steering angle,  acceleration pedal and brake. Besides that, it will also handle the 100 millisecond connection latency and retrieve the predicted trajectory from the model predictive controller and propagate the line in front of the vehicle.  
- [MPC.cpp](./src/ukf.cpp): Initializes the model predictive controller, define the cost calculation, set the contraints, process data and return actuator commands and predicted trajectory. Defines `FG_eval()` and `Solve()`.  
- [README.md](./README.md): Writeup for this project, including setup, running instructions and project rubric addressing.  
- [CMakeLists.txt](./CMakeLists.txt): `CMakeLists.txt` file that will be used when compiling your code (you do not need to change this file)
## Run the project  
* Clone this respository
* At the top level of the project repository, create a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
* In `/build` directory, compile yoru code with `cmake .. && make`
* Launch the simulator from Windows
* Execute the run command for the project `./mpc` (Make sure you also run the simulator on the Windows host machine) If you see * * this message, it is working `Listening to port 4567 Connected!!!`

## Tips

1. It's recommended to test the MPC on basic examples to see if your implementation behaves as desired. One possible example
is the vehicle starting offset of a straight line (reference). If the MPC implementation is correct, after some number of timesteps
(not too many) it should find and track the reference line.
2. The `lake_track_waypoints.csv` file has the waypoints of the lake track. You could use this to fit polynomials and points and see of how well your model tracks curve. NOTE: This file might be not completely in sync with the simulator so your solution should NOT depend on it.
3. For visualization this C++ [matplotlib wrapper](https://github.com/lava/matplotlib-cpp) could be helpful.)
4.  Tips for setting up your environment are available [here](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/0949fca6-b379-42af-a919-ee50aa304e6a/lessons/f758c44c-5e40-4e01-93b5-1a82aa4e044f/concepts/23d376c7-0195-4276-bdf0-e02f1f3c665d)
5. **VM Latency:** Some students have reported differences in behavior using VM's ostensibly a result of latency.  Please let us know if issues arise as a result of a VM environment.

## Code Style

Please (do your best to) stick to [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

## Project Rubric  
### 1. Compilation  
#### 1.1 Your code should compile.  
Yes, it does.  
### 2. Implementation  
#### 2.1 The Model  
Please see my notes/comments/documentation in [`MPC.cpp`](./src/MPC.cpp).  
#### 2.2 Timestep Length and Elapsed Duration (N & dt)  
Start with N = 25, dt = 0.05 then stawy with N = 10, dt = 0.1 at [`MPC.cpp` Line8-10](./src/MPC.cpp#L8-L10).  
Because the latency is around 100 millisecond, setting dt = 0.1 can synchronize the laging.  
As dt = 0.1, then N = 25 makes the prediction a little bit further but cause more calculation consumption.  
Based on the speed (~55 mph) I have, 10 is good enough and 25 is not that bad.  
#### 2.3 Polynomial Fitting and MPC Preprocessing  
Polynomial fitting was called at [`main.cpp` Line120-124](./src/main.cpp#L120-L124).  
Polynomial fitting was implemented at [`main.cpp` Line44-66](./src/main.cpp#L44-L66).  
MPC preprocessing was implemented at [`main.cpp` Line104-118](./src/main.cpp#L104-L118).  
#### 2.4 Model Predictive Control with Latency  
The latency was handled at [`main.cpp` Line126-151](./src/main.cpp#L126-L151).  
Also, one line changed at [`main.cpp` Line228](./src/main.cpp#L228).  
### 3. Simulation  
#### 3.1 The vehicle must successfully drive a lap around the track.  
Yes, it does. Please see the videos below.
